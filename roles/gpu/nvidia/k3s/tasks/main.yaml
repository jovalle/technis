# containerd v1.4 did away with runtime/runc v1. This took a lot of reverse
# engineering several github issues, some trial and error and some luck.
# The most notable resources:
#   - Deprecation notice: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.4.0/RELEASES.md#deprecated-features
#   - For v1: https://k3d.io/v5.2.2/usage/advanced/cuda/?h=cuda
#   - For v2: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/1468
#             https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/issues/275
