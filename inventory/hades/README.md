# Technis

## Context

Comprises of baremetal and virtual machines. Home to my media/data management apps and is roughly my "production" environment.

`deploy.sh` uses `k3sup` to very easily deploy a `k3s` cluster with unprecedented idempotency. My preferred method of installing and maintaining a Kubernetes cluster.

### Host Naming Convention

All hosts are named after characters from `Hades the Game`. Loved the game and the universe it transported me to while playing.
